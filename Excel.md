## Selection range - quick reference
In `Formulas` hit `Create from Selection` which creates quick references to any selected range of data. Don't forget to include your selection header if exists.

Then when using for instance =AVERAGE(`selection_name`) use the selection name as the 
input range. 

If you can't remember the selection name, hit `F3` when typing it into the formula.
