1. Install Discord
2. Install Discord PTB (probably means portable, but not sure why this must be installed, anyway, you can't proceed with next step without having this installed)
3. Install BetterDiscord app.
4. Run BetterDiscord app, go to Settings -> Plugins and search and install  `DisplayServersAsChannels`
5. Enjoy!
